# TwitchCheck

This a web page that shows whether a channel is currently streaming on Twitch TV from a give list of channels.  

## I have to fulfil these [User Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)  

- I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.  
- I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.  
- I can see if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.  
- I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed).  

I'll be using APIs to get the job done.  

You can drop me a mail at akashgajjar8@gmail.com for any suggestions or queries.  

Peace
